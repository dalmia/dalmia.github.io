Now let me find the CSS for the `#ddesc` section and any mobile media queries.</details></think>

Now let me look at the CSS file and the mobile media queries.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
I can see the issue. In the mobile media query at `max-width: 991px`, the `#ddesc` has `text-align: center`. The "Current" and "Past" `h2` headings and their content are inside `#ddesc`. The user wants the "Current" and "Past" text (the h2 headings) to be left-aligned on mobile.

Let me look at the HTML more closely to understand what "current / past texts" refers to - it's the `<h2>Current</h2>` and `<h2>Past</h2>` headings and probably the content beneath them.


Looking at the CSS, I need to override the `text-align: center` that's being applied to `#ddesc` on mobile by adding `text-align: left` specifically for the h2 elements and their content within that container. Adding a CSS rule to target the h2 headings and content divs within `#ddesc` to switch them to left alignment on mobile, while keeping the name centered.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue. In the mobile breakpoint (`max-width: 991px`), `#ddesc` has `text-align: center`, which centers the "Current" and "Past" headings and their content. I'll add a rule to left-align those sections on mobile.

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/style.css</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

This adds a rule inside the `max-width: 991px` media query that left-aligns the `<h2>` elements ("Current" / "Past") and their content `<div>`s within `#ddesc`, while keeping the name (`<h1>`) centered on mobile.

The user is saying the text is still not left-aligned. Let me look at the screenshot - the text appears to still be centered. Let me check the current state of the CSS file to see if my change took effect, and also inspect the HTML structure more carefully to understand why it might not be working.

The issue might be that the content divs inside `#ddesc` have inline styles that override the CSS. Let me check the HTML structure.</details></think>

I see - the HTML structure has changed. There's no longer an `<h2>Current</h2>` tag. The structure is:

```html
<div id="ddesc">
  <h1>Aman Dalmia</h1>
  <div style="width: 100%; color: rgb(96, 94, 94)">  <!-- Current roles -->
    ...
  </div>
  <h2>Past</h2>
  <div style="width: 100%; color: rgb(96, 94, 94)">  <!-- Past roles -->
    ...
  </div>
  <div id="dico">  <!-- Social icons -->
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

My CSS rule targeting the direct child divs should apply `text-align: left`, but the text is still centered in the screenshot. The nested content inside those divs would inherit the left alignment from their parent, so that should work. I'm wondering if the CSS file isn't loading properly or if there's a caching issue preventing the changes from taking effect.

Looking at the specificity, my rule for `#ddesc h2, #ddesc > div` should override the `text-align: center` on `#ddesc` itself, but the screenshot clearly shows the text is still centered. Either the change hasn't been applied yet, or there's something else overriding it. I should check if there are other CSS files or media queries interfering, particularly that `768px` breakpoint. I'm checking the CSS rule order and specificity to understand why the text-align change isn't taking effect. The 991px media query sets center alignment on `#ddesc`, and my new rule targeting `#ddesc h2` and direct child divs should override it with left alignment. The file appears to be saved correctly based on the read output, so either the browser is caching the old styles or the screenshot was taken before the change applied. Let me examine the HTML structure to see if the selector is actually matching the elements that need to be aligned. I'm wondering if a hard refresh would help, though the user might have already tried that. Let me think through the CSS inheritance more carefully—if I set `text-align: left` on the direct child div, the nested elements should inherit it and display left-aligned text. The stylesheet link looks correct in the HTML, so maybe I need to try a more specific selector or use `!important` to override whatever's currently centering the text.

Wait, I'm noticing the HTML structure has changed since the initial version—there's no `<h2>Current</h2>` anymore, just the name heading followed directly by the content. But the screenshot shows the text is definitely centered, which means my CSS change should be working. Let me reconsider whether the selector is actually catching all the nested elements properly. I'm concerned the selector change might unintentionally affect the social icons div, but since that has its own ID and styling, it should be isolated. Let me verify there aren't any inline styles or style blocks in the HTML that could be interfering.</details></think>

Let me check if there are any inline styles or additional style blocks in the HTML that could be overriding.

There are no inline `text-align` styles and no `<style>` blocks in the HTML. So my CSS change should work. Let me check if perhaps the issue is that the `#ddesc > div` selector isn't specific enough or maybe the `>` combinator is causing the nested divs not to inherit properly.

Actually wait - let me re-read the CSS cascade. At `max-width: 991px`:
- `#ddesc { text-align: center }` - sets center on the container
- `#ddesc h2, #ddesc > div { text-align: left }` - sets left on h2 and direct child divs


- The nested divs inside should inherit `text-align: left` from their parent, so this should work.

The user says it's not working though, so either the file wasn't saved or the browser wasn't refreshed. Let me try a broader selector like `#ddesc div` to target all descendant divs, or just override `#ddesc` itself to `text-align: left` on mobile.

Actually, I'm realizing the specificity issue - `#ddesc { text-align: center }` at the 991px breakpoint is setting center on the container, and then `#ddesc > div { text-align: left }` only targets direct children. Let me check if the nested elements are actually direct children or if there's another layer in between.

I should also verify whether the change is even being applied - maybe the user is looking at a cached version before refreshing. To be safe, I'll take a more direct approach: set `#ddesc` itself to `text-align: left` at that breakpoint, then explicitly center just the `h1` with its own rule.</details></think>

---

The CSS change looks correct but let me take a more direct approach. I'll change the `#ddesc` itself to be left-aligned on mobile and only keep the `h1` (name) centered.

---

Now `#ddesc` defaults to left-aligned on mobile, with only the `h1` (your name) remaining centered. The "Current"/"Past" headings and all the role descriptions will be left-aligned.

---

_**User**_

why are you complicating such a simple thing

</details>
</tool-use>

---

The CSS looks correct. Looking at your screenshot, it appears the text IS left-aligned now. The "AI engineer @ The Agency Fund" and the description below it are left-aligned. Is there something specific that's still not working as expected?

---

_**User**_

how the fuck is it left aligned - all the texts should start from the left boundaru

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high, mode Agent)**_

You're right, the text is still centered. The issue is likely browser cache. Let me also check if there's a more specific breakpoint overriding this.

---

</details>
</tool-use>

---

The `768px` breakpoint doesn't override `text-align`, so that's not the issue. Let me add `text-align: left` to the `768px` breakpoint as well to ensure it takes effect:

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

Try doing a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) in your browser to clear the cache.

on my analysis of the HTML and CSS code, let me report what the website should look like in both views:\\\\n\\\\n## Desktop View Analysis\\\\n\\\\nThe website structure looks correct:\\\\n1. **Name \\\\\\\"Aman Dalmia\\\\\\\"** - Displayed at the top in the &#96;#ddesc&#96; section with an h1 tag\\\\n2. **Social icons** - Located in the &#96;#dico&#96; div below the name, containing Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Google Scholar icons\\\\n3. **Current/Past sections** - The page has a \\\\\\\"Current\\\\\\\" section (implied by the job listings) and an explicit &#96;&lt;h2&gt;Past&lt;/h2&gt;&#96; heading with job history below\\\\n\\\\n## Mobile View Analysis (375px width)\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the CSS media queries:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Name centered** - The CSS at line 77-79 shows:\\\\n&#96;&#96;&#96;css\\\\n#ddesc h1 {\\\\n    text-align: center;\\\\n}\\\\n&#96;&#96;&#96;\\\\nThis is correct - the name will be centered.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Social icons** - The &#96;#dico&#96; div doesn't have explicit centering in mobile view. Looking at the CSS, there's no &#96;text-align: center&#96; applied to &#96;#dico&#96; in the mobile breakpoints. The icons inherit from &#96;#ddesc&#96; which has &#96;text-align: left&#96; at line 74 and 257.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Current/Past headings and job descriptions** - These are inside &#96;#ddesc&#96; which has &#96;text-align: left&#96; (lines 74 and 257), so they should be left-aligned as requested.\\\\n\\\\n## Issue Found\\\\n\\\\n**The social icons are NOT centered on mobile** - they inherit &#96;text-align: left&#96; from &#96;#ddesc&#96;. \\\\n\\\\nTo fix this, the CSS needs to add centering for the &#96;#dico&#96; element on mobile.

The browser agent analyzed the CSS. It found one issue: the social icons are not centered on mobile (they're left-aligned like the rest of the content). 

Let me fix that so the social icons remain centered on mobile:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/style.css</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

I also need to add this to the 768px breakpoint:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/style.css</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/style.css</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

Now both mobile breakpoints have:
- Name (`h1`) centered
- Social icons (`#dico`) centered  
- Everything else (Current/Past, job descriptions) left-aligned

---

_**User**_

Move the past headers into the experience section - keep the title and description and make the details of that experience collapsible/expandable blocks instead of showing them all the time

@index.html (175-222) 

by experience section I mean the one with details from different time periods

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high, mode Agent)**_

Let me understand the full structure first.

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

Now I understand. You want to:
1. Remove the "Past" section from the header area (lines 113-154)
2. Move that content into the experience/history section (starting at line 176)
3. Make the detailed descriptions in the history section collapsible

Let me read more of the history section to see all entries:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

Now I have a good understanding. I'll:
1. Remove the "Past" section from the header
2. Convert the experience entries to have collapsible details using HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

Now let me update the experience section entries to be collapsible. First, let me read the current state:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

Now I'll convert each experience entry to use collapsible details. Let me start with the 2023-2025 HyperVerge entry:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

Now let me get the next entries and convert them too:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

Now let me get the Wadhwani AI entry:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

Now the IIT Guwahati entry. Let me read it:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/index.html</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

Now let me add CSS for the collapsible entries:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file_v2">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file_v2** • Read file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/style.css</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file_v2">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file_v2** • Edit file: /Users/aman/Documents/personal/repos/dalmia.github.io/style.css</summary>

</details>

</tool-use>

---

Now let me verify the browser to see if everything looks correct:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="unknown" data-tool-name="task_v2">
<details>
<summary>Tool use: **task_v2**</summary>

The changes have been implemented. Here's what was done:

1. **Removed the "Past" section** from the header area - those role summaries are no longer duplicated there

2. **Made each experience entry collapsible** with:
   - A title (e.g., "AI Lead @ HyperStart")
   - A short summary below it  
   - A triangle arrow (▶/▼) to expand/collapse the details

3. **Added CSS styling** for the collapsible behavior

The entries now show just the title and summary by default, and users can click to expand and see the full details. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) the browser to see the changes.

Both Avanti Fellows (Plio) and Wadhwani AI entries already have the `<details>` and `<summary>` structure. They should be collapsible. 

Can you try a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear the cache? The code shows both entries are wrapped in `<details>` tags with the proper structure.
