# Check website mobile/desktop views (2026-02-11 07:26Z)

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high, mode Agent)**_

I'll check the browser and verify the website layout in both desktop and mobile views.

MCP file system options are required for CallMcpTool

It seems there's an issue with the MCP browser tools. Let me check if there's a terminal running the server and try a different approach.

The server is running. Let me read the HTML and CSS files to understand the current state of the website, and then I can provide feedback based on the code since the browser tools are having issues.

Based on my analysis of the HTML and CSS code, let me report what the website should look like in both views:

## Desktop View Analysis

The website structure looks correct:
1. **Name "Aman Dalmia"** - Displayed at the top in the `#ddesc` section with an h1 tag
2. **Social icons** - Located in the `#dico` div below the name, containing Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Google Scholar icons
3. **Current/Past sections** - The page has a "Current" section (implied by the job listings) and an explicit `<h2>Past</h2>` heading with job history below

## Mobile View Analysis (375px width)

Looking at the CSS media queries:

1. **Name centered** - The CSS at line 77-79 shows:
```css
#ddesc h1 {
    text-align: center;
}
```
This is correct - the name will be centered.

2. **Social icons** - The `#dico` div doesn't have explicit centering in mobile view. Looking at the CSS, there's no `text-align: center` applied to `#dico` in the mobile breakpoints. The icons inherit from `#ddesc` which has `text-align: left` at line 74 and 257.

3. **Current/Past headings and job descriptions** - These are inside `#ddesc` which has `text-align: left` (lines 74 and 257), so they should be left-aligned as requested.

## Issue Found

**The social icons are NOT centered on mobile** - they inherit `text-align: left` from `#ddesc`. 

To fix this, the CSS needs to add centering for the `#dico` element on mobile. Let me verify this is the case by checking if there's any centering applied to `#dico`.

The `#dico` div is only defined in the HTML and referenced in the specstory history. It has no CSS styling in `style.css`. This confirms:

## Report

### Desktop View
- **Name "Aman Dalmia"**: Should display at top ✅
- **Social icons below name**: Should display below name ✅  
- **Current/Past sections**: Should display with job listings ✅

### Mobile View (~375px width)
Based on the CSS:

1. **Name centered**: ✅ CSS explicitly centers h1 with `text-align: center`

2. **Social icons centered**: ❌ **NOT CENTERED** - The `#dico` div has no explicit styling. It inherits `text-align: left` from its parent `#ddesc` (which is explicitly set to `text-align: left` at lines 74 and 257 in the CSS). The social icons will be left-aligned, not centered.

3. **Current/Past headings and job descriptions LEFT ALIGNED**: ✅ The `#ddesc` has `text-align: left` for mobile, so headings like "Past" (h2) and the job descriptions will be left-aligned.

### Summary
The mobile view has **one issue**: the social icons are NOT centered - they are left-aligned like the rest of the content. If you want them centered on mobile (as stated in your requirements), you need to add CSS to center the `#dico` element specifically on mobile screens.

Would you like me to fix the social icons centering for mobile view?
