        <p>At HyperVerge Academy, we support people from under-resourced
            backgrounds
            to get jobs in tech. This requires completing tasks designed to
            build
            their
            skills. But reviewing their submissions and providing meaningful
            feedback
            was a challenge. Here, we saw an opportunity for AI and built
            SensAI--a
            coach that doesn't just mark answers right or wrong, but pushes
            a
            learner
            to think deeply about their approach and nudges them in the
            right
            direction.</p>

        <p>Our early results were encouraging—learners valued the feedback
            and
            started
            using it to work towards the right solutions. In 2023, we tried
            something
            similar but it didn’t work. Looking back, we found two key
            reasons:
        </p>

        <p>AI alone wasn’t enough. Earlier, we used AI to create the entire
            curriculum. But the questions lacked variety and depth. This
            time,
            we
            designed 200+ tasks ourselves, using AI as an assistant.</p>

        <p>Second, people need to feel a sense of progress. We introduced
            streaks
            and
            leaderboards, but instead of tracking tasks completed, we
            rewarded
            consistency—attempting at least one task daily. Learners qujckly
            became
            invested in extending their streaks.</p>

        <p>Soon, we realised that the chat interface is not intuitive for
            programming. So, we integrated a code editor where they can run
            their
            code and see the output before submitting it, combining the best
            of
            Replit and ChatGPT.</p>

        <p>Moving beyond text was the next step. Soft skills—like explaining
            ideas
            clearly or writing professional emails—are critical for jobs,
            but
            1:1
            coaching cannot scale. Letting learners speak, with AI analyzing
            their
            speech, enabled us to assess confidence, pronunciation, grammar
            and
            clarity.
            We also let educators set their own scoring criteria for a given
            task,
            moving beyond questions with a fixed correct answer. This opened
            up
            new
            ways
            to practice communication skills, written and verbal,
            effectively.
        </p>

        <p>We closed the loop with AI-generated insights. Educators can see
            where
            every
            learner is struggling and provide tailored support. SensAI has
            grown
            from an
            AI coach to a complete learning platform—one that helps learners
            build
            skills, get feedback, and track progress, while letting
            educators
            create
            cohorts, design courses, observe and iterate.</p>

        <p>SensAI has enabled us to upskill learners in programming, logical
            reasoning,
            communication skills, and help them prepare for interviews.
            Beyond
            HyperVerge Academy, teams within HyperVerge are already using
            SensAI
            for
            onboarding new team members, certifying sales teams, and
            designing
            courses
            for lead generation.</p>

        <p>SensAI is open-source. We run a small community of builders in AI
            +
            Education. For us, this is one step toward realizing the
            potential
            of AI
            in
            education. Join us, and let us take the next steps together.</p>
