        <h2>Forgiving myself and embracing who I am</h2>
        <p>
            For the last few years, I have lived a very apologetic life. A lot
            of
            people might disagree with that. But I know I have. I have lived in
            the
            fear of hurting others with my actions. Lived in the thought that
            there
            is something fundamentally flawed with me. All of us are flawed in
            our
            own ways. But I took it to the extreme by believing that no one
            wants me
            to be around. That the best way for me to exist is to be silent. To
            disappear. Be invisible, if possible. So, every time someone tries
            to
            see me, I run away and hide in my corner. It is safer there. When I
            am
            around people, I have to listen to this constant voice inside my
            head
            saying that everyone hates me. That I am a liability. I am no fun to
            be
            around. I need to justify my existence and presence around them.
            Otherwise, they will reject me and I will be left all alone very
            soon.
            Choosing to be alone is a different matter because this choice comes
            from a place of agency. But being rejected is a horrible feeling.
            One
            that I have gone through more times than I would ever wish upon
            anyone
            else.

            I have always had a distaste for authority, starting from my own
            home. I
            have never enjoyed someone giving me unsolicited advice, especially
            someone who does not really know who I am as a person today. I have
            not
            been able to be in the same job for more than 2 years, in the last 7
            years of working in startups and non-profits. Eventually, the
            distaste
            catches up. I am grateful that I have almost always loved working
            with
            the people around me, but at some point, things come down to a
            judgement
            call and when I am not able to make that call, I feel crippled. It
            is in
            those moments I realise that I am not made to work for someone else.
            I
            am just fundamentally unable to do so, something one of my mentors
            had
            identified a long time back.

            Coming from a middle-class family that has seen a lot of struggles
            due
            to money (a struggle that continues to be present today in the
            psyche of
            my family members even though our reality has changed), it is
            impossible
            to not be grateful for having a well-paying job. Truly, I am
            grateful
            for all the wonderful places I have had th chance to work at and all
            the
            incredible people I have met and learnt from. Still, that nagging
            voice has always been there, wispering things like "You don't belong
            here", "This is not you", "You cannot work with people who don't
            care as
            deeply as you do", "You need to be in charge", "They just don't get
            it",
            "Why do you have to do this".
        </p>

            All these years I have been fighting this voice. Reprimanding it for
            being too selfish, unrealistic, egoistic and ungrateful. While I am
            sure
            that all of those labels are true, at least to some extent, it does
            not
            change the fact that it is who I am. As much as I have tried to run
            away
            from my true self, I have continued to live in misery because of not
            embracing my true nature. However, over the last many years, thanks
            to
            social media, internet and YouTube, I also got to meet and know
            people
            who seem just like me. When I hear them talk, I can hear myself in
            them.
            Suddenly, I don't seem like a weirdo who is different from anyone
            else
            and struggles to connect with most people. Here are these people
            whom I
            can listen to for hours and whom I would like to spend a good chunk
            of
            my waking hours with. People who reasonate with me and amplify my
            energy.
            Those who charge me up. And now, only now, I am starting to see
            that I
            cannot run away from who I am. Even though I can forsee all the
            issues
            that will come from embracing my true self, I can't help but give in
            to
            it. The alternative is too painful. Not being myself, primarily to
            avoid
            the consequences that lie at the end of the road is making the
            journey I am curently on not worth pursuing in the first place.

            Yes, I have hurt a lot of people. I continue to hurt
            people
            around me. Hopefully, much lesser now. I have also been hurt
            a
            lot. My confidence has taken a severe beating in multiple
            phases.
            But it is time to move on from the past. It is time to let it go. Of
            course, simply saying that won't change things overnight. It will
            take
            its time. But I know now that I need to let bygones be bygones and
            focus
            on the present. I know it sounds like a cliché but there is a reason
            it
            is a cliché. I learnt it from my mom. As I sat beside her today, I
            coulnd't help but wonder how she manages to remain happy all the
            time,
            despite having gone through so many difficult times with the same
            people
            who created that misery being present around her every day. Even
            though
            I like to harp about Vipassana, she is the one who has truly learnt
            its
            lesson. There is no point living in the past or in the future. We
            have
            to see the present for what it is. And if things are good today,
            why
            not be happy about it? I know it sounds like a simple idea but it
            can be
            very difficult to practice. But I have a role model to emulate that
            right in front of me. I hope some of her light shines on me as well.
            It
            is time to start forgiving myself for what I have done, let go of
            the
            pain I have received from others that is holding me back and focus
            on
            the love and belief that my mother and others close to me continue
            to
            shower upon me every day.
