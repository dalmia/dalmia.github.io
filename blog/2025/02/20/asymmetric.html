        <h2>Living an asymmetric life (by Graham Weaver)</h2>

        <p>
            I have been on a negative spiral for some time now. Last night,
            I
            shared the gory details of it with one of my closest friends,
            someone
            who has seen me for many years. He knows my patterns and did not shy
            away from calling out the fact that I was replaying one of them
            again. He made me see how my negative self-talk is causing it.
            Towards the end of our chat, he sent me a <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZxbVGhpEkI">talk</a>
            given by
            Graham Weaver in Stanford's Graduate School of
            Business on living an asymmetric life where he gives the
            antedote to
            fear. The talk was precisely what I
            need to hear and this is a summary of my key takeaways.
        </p>

        <h4>1. Do The Hard things</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>We usually live our lives protecting the downside. This is
                holding us back. Our fear will eventually cause the very thing
                we are
                trying to prevent.</li>
            <li>It stops us from wondering what would happen if things turned
                out
                well. The ultimate downside is death. We don't know when we
                might die.</li>
            <li>Once we are in our comfort zone, we start believing that life is
                supposed to be easy. This is the opposite of what we need to do.
                It keeps
                us stagnant.</li>
            <li>Any change is going to be worse first. Fear is the biggest cause
                of
                the initial slump. Over time, once we overcome our fear, we can
                make the
                slump shallower for every subsequent change.</li>
            <li>We can push ourselves much harder than we think we can.</li>
            <li>Start playing for the upside.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Do Your Thing</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>As Buddha discovered, life is a suffering. We have to find what
                is
                worth suffering for.</li>
            <li>We are never going to win living someone else's dream.</li>
            <li>One factor we fail to consider: how we operate when we are
                turned on
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Do It For Decades</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>If you focus on improving yourself every day and do it for a
                long
                time, your rate of compounding will make you the best at what
                you do.</li>
            <li>You need to enjoy what you are doing to be able do it for a
                decade.</li>
            <li>There is no problem that you cannot tackle if you are at it
                while
                being at your best for a decade.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Write Your Story</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>We never stop to visualize what do we want the story of our life
                to
                be.</li>
            <li>"How" is the killer of all dreams. Write your dream first.
            </li>
            <li>Assume that
                you are going to be successful at whatever you decide to do.
                What would
                you choose to do?</li>
            <li>Now, make it happen. Put yourself
                out
                there. The universe will respond. You will attract the right
                things.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Fear is the biggest obstacle holding us back. It
            disguises
            itself as our friend, as the "practical" thing to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            As "not me,
            not
            now".
        </p>

        <p>
            Do what you are afraid of.
        </p>

        <p>
            While talking to my friend, I realised I keep echoing what
            different people have said to me over the years and made their
            opinion of me my reality. I stopped believing in myself and have
            done a
            lot of
            damage to my self-confidence. This talk reminded me of what I truly
            resonate
            with and what I really want. I hold back from talking about my
            dreams.
            Even thinking about them.
        </p>

        <p>Today is when that starts to change.</p>
