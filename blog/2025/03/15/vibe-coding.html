        <h3>Before you build</h3>
        <p>
            Before jumping into coding, it has been super helpful for me to
            clearly
            list out
            all the ideal user flows for different scenarios. Several people
            have
            helped me
            a lot with that. As engineers, we are biased towards building. But
            taking a step
            back to just draw it all out without worrying about how we will
            implement it is
            very important.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have the ideal user flows listed, begin with any one flow.
            Since you
            already know the steps that lie ahead, you can be very specific
            about
            what you
            want the LLM/agent to do (I'll call them LLMs going forward). LLMs
            are
            (usually)
            good at building something specific rather than building a whole
            system
            themselves. Sure, you can see many people demoing that from a single
            prompt they
            can build an entire game or app. From my experience, it is true that
            they can
            give a very good headstart when starting a new app. But once your
            app
            grows and
            if you have a specific flow (and taste) in mind, then, breaking it
            down
            into
            small steps and asking it to execute that individual step is what
            has
            worked for
            me - sometimes in one shot and sometimes with multiple iterations of
            me
            specifying where it went wrong and reiterating what I actually asked
            for.
        </p>

        <h3>Get started with Lovable</h3>
        <p>
            Lovable seemed the best out of v0/bolt/lovable when I tried a couple
            of
            the same
            prompts on all of them in terms of aesthetics, design, flow of the
            app
            and in
            general, matching what I had in my mind. It is still far from
            perfect,
            but at
            least better than the rest.
        </p>

        <p>
            I use it when I want different variations of how to build a
            component,
            or when I
            already have a specific component from an app whose style I want to
            copy. I just
            provide Lovable with an example of my current app's design and ask
            it to
            adapt
            that feature to match my app's theme.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes I ask it to build a feature entirely and provide different
            variants so
            that I can easily see what definitely looks ugly, what might work,
            and
            get some
            good ideas. I do this by explicitly asking it to show me different
            ways
            in which
            it can be done and to be creative with layout, style, orientation,
            theme, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Build for real with Cursor</h3>
        <p>
            Pull whatever looks like a decent start into Cursor if you are
            starting
            from
            scratch or just take a screenshot of the component you liked and
            pass
            that to
            Cursor. Cursor is where the real power is unlocked.
        </p>

        <p>There are a lot of things I have learned in my short time:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Chat vs Composer:</strong> I mostly use the Composer and
                in
                the
                "agent" mode
                in Composer (instead of "normal" mode). They removed this
                distinction in
                the
                0.46 version of Cursor but I found that version to be very buggy
                and so
                did a
                lot of people. Most of us reverted back to 0.45 and life has
                been (more)
                peaceful again. I occasionally use the Chat mode when I have to
                ask something about the codebase but I don't want it to execute
                any code.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>File Tagging:</strong> Always include all relevant files
                (tag them with @filename) that
                you
                think will
                be needed to implement a feature or debug an error in every
                prompt and
                every
                follow-up message. I cannot emphasize how important this is to
                ensure it
                does
                not keep going on and on
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Excess Edits:</strong> It often makes excess edits that
                I didn't ask for. A lot of
                times, it
                makes
                unnecessarily big changes when adding just two words would
                suffice. I
                have to
                keep reminding Sonnet not to overcomplicate things and to keep
                it
                simple. Even
                though this is explicitly included in Cursor rules, it continues
                to make
                this
                mistake repeatedly.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Clear Instructions:</strong> You need to remember that
                if what you have said can be
                interpreted in
                different
                ways, it is going to be interpreted the wrong way a few times.
                So, be
                very clear
                with what you want and make sure that you have covered all the
                edge
                cases that
                it could spin off to and explicitly ask it to not do something
                if you
                have
                noticed that there is a pattern to the mistakes it makes.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Frequent Commits:</strong> Commit very
                frequentlyâ€”ideally, as soon as any minor thing
                works. It
                tends to
                delete random stuff that previously worked when you introduce
                new
                features. Set
                up end-to-end testing to prevent that, but if testing isn't set
                up, find
                the
                commit where something broke. You can pass the diff to it
                directly,
                saying,
                "This change you made broke this feature. Fix it."
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Cursor Rules:</strong> Cursor rules and project rules
                exist and they do help a lot but
                I'm not
                entirely
                sure exactly how effective they really are. Since everyone on
                the
                internet kept
                saying that Cursor rules are important, I have added them but
                don't know
                precisely how much of a lift they give me.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Use Checkpoints:</strong> Cursor provides checkpoints
                after every change it has made and
                you can
                restore
                to any of those checkpoints. Use checkpoints frequently to roll
                back
                your code
                if something it has added didn't work or broke something or the
                change
                was just
                useless, not really fixing that bug or implementing that
                feature. Once
                you
                identify common points of failure, update the prompt to ensure
                it
                doesn't repeat
                the same mistakes.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Fresh Chats:</strong> Keep opening new chats after each
                microfeature is completed;
                otherwise,
                unnecessary history and context get carried forward into
                subsequent
                features
                that don't need it causing distraction and introducing potential
                sources
                of
                error.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Model Selection:</strong> I usually stick with Sonnet
                3.7 until it stops working, then
                switch to
                "thinking" if it keeps making the same mistake for a given task.
                For
                complicated
                tasks, thinking is usually better, but using it in the regular
                (non-thinking)
                mode might be sufficient for simpler tasks given that the
                thinking model
                now
                incurs 2 credits instead of 1.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Documentation Limits:</strong> Even though it accepts
                URLs, I've found it's not great at
                reading
                documentation
                from URLs, especially for less popular tools. Often, I've had to
                manually read
                documentation and then send specific code snippets from itâ€”like,
                "Hey,
                this is
                how it's done. Do it now."
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Pinpoint Edits:</strong> Eventually, as your codebase
                grows, you'll need to go into the
                codebase
                and
                point out specific edits. Sometimes it makes complicated changes
                across
                5 files
                when all it had to do was add 2 words to a line. So, if you
                think
                something is
                simple but it is not able to do it, you are probably right. When
                I
                encounter
                such cases, I just find the exact code section which needs a fix
                and
                make the
                fix manually by reading the code (often for the first time).
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Code Structure:</strong> I often glance quickly at the
                code and files, then instruct it
                to create
                new
                components and reuse them, because I've noticed it tends to
                copy-paste
                code
                excessively instead of making reusable components. It is not
                great at
                structuring code. If you go on for too long without intervening
                in
                between to
                periodically keep restructuring the code, it can be hard to
                scale and
                you will
                likely introduce a lot of bugs that will be harder to find and
                debug as
                your
                codebase grows (which happens very quickly when you use LLMs for
                coding).
            </li>

        <h3>Generate beautiful SVGs with Claude.ai</h3>
        <p>
            Claude.ai is great at generating beautiful SVGs as you work with its
            Canvas.
            Keep iterating and giving feedback and you can quickly get your own
            custom SVG.
        </p>

        <h3>Create engaging copy with GPT4.5 / Claude.ai</h3>
        <p>
            Cursor is not that good at writing good copy for different
            placeholders
            or
            different parts of the app where we need to communicate with the
            users.
            I found
            a mix of GPT4.5 / Claude 3.7 the app to be great at understanding my
            intent of
            what I want to communicate and giving me good samples for the copy
            that
            I am now
            using throughout the app.
