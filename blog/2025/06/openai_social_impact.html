        <h2>Learnings from OpenAI's event on AI for Social Impact</h2>

        <p>
            Last week, I attended OpenAI's event on AI for Social Impact in
            Bangalore.
        </p>

        <p>
            Engineers from OpenAI gave a walkthrough of their new Agents SDK and
            shared what to expect in the coming months. This was followed by
            lightning talks from non-profits like Rocket Learning, Noora Health,
            Udhyam Learning Foundation and others, showcasing how they are
            already
            putting AI to use on the ground.

        </p>

        <p>
            I spoke about SensAI, an AI-powered LMS we are building to help
            educators provide real-time, personalized support to learners while
            reducing their own workload. I also shared some of the learnings
            from
            our journey so far.

        </p>

        <p>
            OpenAI also launched <a href="https://academy.openai.com">OpenAI
                Academy</a> in
            India, a learning platform for individuals and teams to apply AI in
            their work (from basics to advanced).

        </p>

        <p>
            Some reflections from the day:
        </p>

        <p>
            𝟏. 𝐂𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐬 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞
            In high-trust roles—teachers, healthcare workers, anganwadi
            staff—people
            rely on trust, accountability, reassurance, and someone who will
            tell it
            like it is. Replacing the human layer rarely works. But giving these
            professionals tools to be more effective? That’s where AI can
            quietly
            but powerfully shift outcomes.

        </p>

        <p>
            𝟐. 𝐑𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐬
            Speaking is faster, more comfortable, and more accessible. In many
            contexts, it's the most natural way to interact. There’s a clear
            shift
            underway—from text-only chat systems to voice-first interfaces.

        </p>

        <p>
            𝟑. 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
            Irrespective of whatever advances are made in LLMs, having a robust
            evals system is crucial for any AI product to succeed. It was
            inspiring
            to see many non-profits adopting the evals-first approach tailored
            to
            their own domain—sometimes with AI’s help, but always grounded in
            the
            real-world needs of their users—something which was missing an year
            back.

        </p>

        <p>
            𝟒. 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐢𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐧-𝐧𝐞𝐠𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞
            English is not enough. For AI to matter to most of India, it needs
            to
            work well in our native languages. That gap is still large—and
            critical
            to close. Frontier models continue to struggle with low-resource
            languages, which leads to a real dilemma for many teams: should they
            wait for the next model update from OpenAI, or start building their
            own
            models to address this gap now?

        </p>

        <p>
            𝟓. 𝐂𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡
            Even with prices dropping 50x in the last two years, AI at the last
            mile
            in India remains expensive. For India’s scale, OpenAI was urged to
            explore a more affordable pricing model specific to this context.
            Evals
            can help here too—by deciding when a much smaller, cheaper model is
            good
            enough instead of defaulting to the largest one.

        </p>

        <p>
            After nearly 7 years working at the intersection of AI and social
            impact, this is the most forward movement I’ve seen. Now it’s about
            building with care, clarity, and deep context.
