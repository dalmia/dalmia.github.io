How to live an asymmetric life: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZxbVGhpEkI

- Do hard things
  - We have more capacity than we think we do
  - Whenever we try something new or something uncomfortable, it is going to be worse first and becomes better over time.
  - Everything you want in life is on the other side of "Worse first"
- Do your thing
  - Life is suffering. So, choose something worth suffering for
- Do it for decades
  - There is no obstacle that won't yield to you at full power for a decade
- Write your story and then make it happen

  - The "how" is the killer of all dreams
  - Write down the dream first and take one step at a time towards it

- Fear holds us back and masks itself as being the practical thing, disguises itself as it is saving us.
- We keep trying to play safe to reduce our downside but we can't avoid losses or downsides
- Play for the upside, just go big. Not to say: not me or not now.
